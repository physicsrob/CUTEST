## Requirements

- Macro Assembler As [http://john.ccac.rwth-aachen.de:8000/as/]
- GNU Make _(recommended)_

To assemble cutest from source, all you need is Macro Assembler As [http://john.ccac.rwth-aachen.de:8000/as/].
The easiest way to assemble is to use the make script include (`Makefile`), but feel free to assemble by hand.

# Assembling
There is a single file, `src/cutest.asm`, which builds both the base image and the extension image.
