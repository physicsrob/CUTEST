cuts method:
	50 nulls are written before any data
	10 nulls and then a 1 are required to proceed header
	no synchronization issue
	data available reliable method of testing if incoming data

tarbell method:
	write:
		3C followed by E6
	read:
		reset before read
		the E6 synchronizes and starts the data stream


	... so how can we do a list function?
	Easy enough to read header
	... how can we find gap?
	

	One option:
		Write:  3C E6 00 00 00 00 00 01 <data>
		Read:
			1. Reset
			2. Test for data up to 64k times (should work out to about a second)
			3. If timeout goto 1, otherwise continue (we have data)
			4. Check if byte is 0, loop until nonzero
			5. Check if count is 5, if not go to 1			
			6. Check if byte is 1, if not goto 1
			7. read
